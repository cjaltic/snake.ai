Initial commit
update readme
created Snake Coordinate Food and Board classes
Implemeted food and coordinate functionality
Implemented the main functionality for the snake class, there's nothing to run it on
so I can't test it right now.  
I'm considering adding a Main class on top of the board class to run it easier

5/4
Completing board functionality
Created GUI class, started GUI implementation
developed GUI class.  able to print out a snake and food
next step is to connect the GUI to the board and get the game running

Got the GUI connected to the board, addressed a few bugs but now the snake
is crawling around the screen smoothly.  Going to take a break but when I come back
need to address the following issues:
	- Create the Board, Snake, etc inside of the Painter constructor
	- get game clock running (right now a "tick" only happens when you hit a button)
	- set up game rules
	- snake can not pass through itself
	- playing field needs borders
	- hitting oneself or hitting the border means death
	- create start and end screen
